# Dynamic-Web-Applications

This module focuses on the technology underpinning client-server applications. You will learn how websites and web applications work and how data can be used to drive dynamic behaviour in those web applications.

A key part of this module is the use of database systems, with an introduction to data modelling and database implementation in SQL and alternatives such as No SQL.   


The main technologies you will encounter on the course include:

- Unix Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- SSH, to connect to the department web server (`Igor') and the department's virtual servers
- Node.js, Express
- SQL
- Relational and Non-relational Database Management Systems (MySQL, MongoDB)
- Transfer protocols: HTTP and TCP
- Git version control system
